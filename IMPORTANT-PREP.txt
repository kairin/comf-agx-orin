good idea to read through first.

1. to get tensorRT working, when creating the virtual environment use the following setting:

➜  apps python3 -m venv --help

  --system-site-packages
                        Give the virtual environment access to the system site-packages dir.
  
Once an environment has been created, you may wish to activate it, e.g. by sourcing an activate script in its bin directory.
➜  apps python3 -m venv .ven1 --system-site-packages
➜  apps source .ven1/bin/activate
(.ven1) ➜  apps python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip




and then, good idea to follow the installation instructions to get the the packages especially jtop/JEP.

while installing some other custom_nodes, i encounter the following issue where  i also need to update the following file: File Name to Write: ~/.zshrc
# update the following paths.
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda/bin
export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib


wait wait wait... can just download the whl file.
